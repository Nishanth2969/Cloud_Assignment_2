Deployments: 2 (Flask, MongoDB) - All Available
ReplicaSets: 2 - All Ready
PersistentVolumeClaims: 1 - Bound

Flask Application:
- Image: flask-todo-app:latest (loaded in Minikube)

- Storage: PVC bound
- Connectivity: Verified and working

==========================================
NOTES
==========================================

1. Port 5000 was in use by macOS Control Center, 
   so Docker Compose uses port 5001 instead.

2. Werkzeug version fixed to 2.0.3 for compatibility
   with Flask 2.1.3.

3. Minikube uses local image with imagePullPolicy: Never
   (ready to change to Docker Hub image when needed).

4. All redundant test scripts have been consolidated
   into test-all.sh for easier maintenance.

==========================================
READY FOR DEMO
==========================================

The assignment is complete and ready for demonstration.
All components have been tested and are working correctly.

To run tests: ./test-all.sh
To deploy: ./deploy-minikube.sh
To validate: ./validate-setup.sh
